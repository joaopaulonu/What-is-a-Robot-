# 🤖 Robotics Basics

This repository is a summary of my study on the fundamental concepts of robotics.  
Its purpose is to provide an overview of what a robot is, its essential components, and how robots are classified and applied across different fields.

## 📖 Origin of the Word "Robot"
The word **“robot”** comes from the Czech term *“robota”*, meaning *“forced labor”* or *“servant.”*  
It is used to describe machines that sense, compute, and act to perform tasks.

## ⚙️ Components of a Robot
- **Mechanics:** The body, arms, legs, and other physical structures for movement.  
- **Electronics:** Provides power, sensors to perceive the environment, and actuators/motors for actions.  
- **Software:** The program that controls and directs the robot’s functions, defining what it should do.

## 🧩 Types of Robots
- **Pre-programmed:** Perform simple, repetitive tasks in controlled environments.  
- **Autonomous:** Operate without human intervention, making decisions based on sensor data.  
- **Humanoids:** Designed to resemble and mimic human appearance and behavior.  
- **Teleoperated:** Controlled remotely by a human operator.  
- **Augmenting Robots:** Enhance human abilities or replace lost functions.

## 🚀 Applications of Robots
Robots are applied in a wide range of fields due to their ability to perform dangerous, repetitive, or highly precise tasks:

- **Industry:** Welding, painting, and assembly.  
- **Medicine:** Assisting in surgeries.  
- **Exploration:** Autonomous vehicles in extreme environments, such as space.  
- **Everyday life:** Robotic vacuum cleaners and self-driving cars.
